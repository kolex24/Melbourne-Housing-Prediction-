# Melbourne-Housing-Prediction-
The projects aims to predict housing price using Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting Regression algorithms, 
The worklow includes data wrangling, feature selection, baseline model setup, and model evaluation using **Decision Tree** and **Gradient Boosting Regression**

## Project Overview
- Built basrline model to establish benchmark performance.
- Trained and compared multiple regression models.
- Evaluate model using **MAE(mean_absolute_error)**, **MSE(mean_squared_error)**, **R2(R-Square)** and **RMSE(root_mean_squared_error)**
- Selecting the best performing model based on predictive accuracy

## Model Used
- **Baseline Score**
- **Decision Tree Regression**
- **Gradient Boosting Regression**

## Model Performance Summary
- **Baseline Score** is 638,356.51 which is the benchmark of our learning algorithms
- **Decision Tree** have 377,743.00 RMSE, 142,689,778,282.41 MSE and 0.65 R_Square
- **Gradient Boosting Regression** have 276,071.0 RMSE, 76215463200.98 MSE and 0.82 R_Square
