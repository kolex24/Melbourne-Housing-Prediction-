# Melbourne-Housing-Prediction-
The projects aims to predict house price using Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting Regression algorithms, 
The worklow includes data wrangling, feature selection, baseline model setup, and model evaluation using **Decision Tree** and **Gradient Boosting Regression**

## Project Overview
- Built basrline model to establish benchmark performance.
- Trained and compared multiple regression models.
- Evaluate model using **MAE(mean_absolute_error)**, **MSE(mean_squared_error)**, **R2(R-Square)** and **RMSE(root_mean_squared_error)**
- Selecting the best performing model based on predictive accuracy

## Model Used
